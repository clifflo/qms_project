    Generic short hook original

    The term 'generic' means that it defines the
    short hook itself. It does not refers to any
    internal or external short hook in a long hook.

    So for a short hook it would have both internal
    and external bean branch series and trunk. So we
    would define ISSHEXT to define which part we
    would like to get --- internal or external.
