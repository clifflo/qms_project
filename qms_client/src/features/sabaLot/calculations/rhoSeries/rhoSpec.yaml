    As of 乾, we will have the branches
    starting from the bottom as 子寅辰午申戌.
    In this case, 子 is the BBSSB.

    Generic short hook original
  spdesn: >
    The term 'generic' means that it defines the
    short hook itself. It does not refers to any
    internal or external short hook in a long hook.

  spfname: Is short hook external part
  spdesn: >-
    So for a short hook it would have both internal
    and external bean branch series and trunk. So we
    would define ISSHEXT to define which part we
    would like to get --- internal or external.

    So we would have to check which cross is striking.
    For the source long hook we would say 'striking'
    and in the target long hook we would say 'from
    strike'.

    It stands for the long hooks of 乾卦宮. As
    there are also 卦宮 in 玄空大卦, I would define
    the 卦宮 in 火珠林 as 午卦宮. So I would use
    乾午卦宮 to calculate the bitwise difference
    with 純乾卦 and then apply those to other 7
    short hooks.
