  spdesn: >
    As of 乾, we will have the branches
    starting from the bottom as 子寅辰午申戌.
    In this case, 子 is the BBSSB.

    Generic short hook original
  spdesn: >
    The term 'generic' means that it defines the
    short hook itself. It does not refers to any
    internal or external short hook in a long hook.

  spals: isShetp
  spfna: Is short hook external part
  spdesn: >-
    So for a short hook it would have both internal
    and external bean branch series and trunk. So we
    would define ISSHEXT to define which part we
    would like to get --- internal or external.

  spals: cestm
  spfna: Cross striking map
  spdesn: >-
    So we would have to check which cross is striking.
    For the source long hook we would say 'striking'
    and in the target long hook we would say 'from
    strike'.

  spals: rblhss
  spfna: Rho base long hook series
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the long hooks of 乾卦宮. As
    there are also 卦宮 in 玄空大卦, I would define
    the 卦宮 in 火珠林 as 午卦宮. So I would use
    乾午卦宮 to calculate the bitwise difference
    with 純乾卦 and then apply those to other 7
    short hooks.

  spals: rlhkss

    So I would calculate all those 7 generated long
    hooks firstly and then I will add back the rho
    head long hook to form the whole long hook series.

  spfna: Rho hook gap binaries set
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the bitwise difference between each
    of the generation between the rho head hook and
    the generated long hook. For example, the hook gap
    binaries between 純乾 and 否 would be 'b111000'.

  spals: rlhgn
  spfna: Rho long hook generation
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the number of 'generation' of a
    rho long hook series. So for 二世卦 the generation
    would be 1. Noted that 世爻 is defined as Rho
    Jack and I do not use 'generation' to define it.

  spals: rhlhb
  spfna: Rho head long hook binaries
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the binaries of the head long hook of

  spals: rglhi
  spfna: Rho generated long hook index
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the process of using the RHGBS tp
    generate those long hooks with different generations.
    For example, 節卦 in 坤午卦宮 is a 午一世卦 and it
    has a generation of 0. 師卦　in 坤午卦宮 is a 午歸魂卦
    and it has a generation of 6. So the long hook
    generated via this process will have index of
    RGLHI.
