    As of 乾, we will have the branches
    starting from the bottom as 子寅辰午申戌.
    In this case, 子 is the BBSSB.

  spals: gshkor
  spfna: Generic short hook original
  spdesn: >-
    The term 'generic' means that it defines the
    short hook itself. It does not refers to any
    internal or external short hook in a long hook.
  spocr: Rho-1

  spals: rhshel
  spfna: Rho head short hook element
  spdesn: >-
    I define with the term 'Rho head' because I do not
    want to refer the long hook with external short hook
    or internal short hook which are irrelevant. So 'Rho
    head' is specifically refers to the 午卦宮 to avoid
    confusion.

  spdesn: >-
    So for a short hook it would have both internal
    and external bean branch series and trunk. So we
    would define ISSHEXT to define which part we
    would like to get --- internal or external.

    So we would have to check which cross is striking.
    For the source long hook we would say 'striking'
    and in the target long hook we would say 'from
    strike'.

  spals: rblhss
  spfna: Rho base long hook series
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the long hooks of 乾卦宮. As
    there are also 卦宮 in 玄空大卦, I would define
    the 卦宮 in 火珠林 as 午卦宮. So I would use
    乾午卦宮 to calculate the bitwise difference
    with 純乾卦 and then apply those to other 7
    short hooks.
  spocr: Rho-4

  spals: rlhkss
  spfna: Rho long hook series

    So I would calculate all those 7 generated long
    hooks firstly and then I will add back the rho

    It stands for the bitwise difference between each

  spals: rlhgn
  spfna: Rho long hook generation
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the number of 'generation' of a

  spals: rglhi
  spfna: Rho generated long hook index
  spdesn: >-
    It stands for the process of using the RHGBS tp
    generate those long hooks with different generations.
    For example, 節卦 in 坤午卦宮 is a 午一世卦 and it
    has a generation of 0. 師卦　in 坤午卦宮 is a 午歸魂卦
    and it has a generation of 6. So the long hook
    generated via this process will have index of
    RGLHI.
